# Setup Project

Prepare a repository so every downstream Phat skill can find trustworthy project context without rediscovering the project from scratch.

Own project initialization, context structure, document navigation, and workflow conventions.

Do not make new product, domain, or architecture decisions.

You may persist decisions that are already agreed through:

* `$grill-workflow`;
* `$grill-design`;
* an explicit user statement;
* an existing requirement;
* an existing ADR;
* another authoritative project record.

Do not implement features.

Do not create feature specifications unless another workflow explicitly owns that step.

Do not create implementation tasks.

## Workflow

Follow this sequence:

```text
Inspect repository
        ↓
Detect new vs existing project
        ↓
Existing implementation?
        ├─ yes + material knowledge gap requiring broad discovery → $code-to-context
        └─ otherwise continue
        ↓
Collect agreed context
        ↓
Configure verification policy
        ↓
Identify existing sources of truth
        ↓
Create/update minimum project documents
        ↓
Link project navigation
        ↓
Validate workflow readiness
        ├─ custom-design discovery requested and still pending → $grill-design
        ├─ visual validation requested → $to-prototype → $edit-prototype* → $spec-with-prototype
        └─ otherwise → $write-spec
```

Keep the project as small as its actual needs allow.

Document count is not a quality metric.

## Inspect before changing

Read existing repository instructions before making changes.

Start with `AGENTS.md` if it exists.

Read `CONTEXT.md` next. For an existing repository with meaningful
implementation, check whether its generated `## Codebase Context` block is
present and fresh before rediscovering repository facts.

Then inspect only what is needed:

* the generated Codebase Context and its source revision;
* `docs/`;
* README or project documentation;
* project manifests;
* package manager configuration;
* CI configuration;
* existing ADRs;
* existing specs and tasks;
* existing prototype assets under `docs/assets/prototype/` when present;
* the existing `## Verification Policy` section in `CONTEXT.md`, when present;
* relevant source structure;
* repository conventions.

## Reuse fresh codebase context

For an existing project with meaningful code or configuration:

1. Reuse human-authored context and any generated snapshot as a repository-fact
   index, verifying relevant claims against current files when necessary.
2. Inspect source, manifests, CI, and commands narrowly to resolve setup gaps.
3. Recommend `$code-to-context` only when a concrete gap blocks setup and needs
   broad discovery. Missing markers, changed SHA, or a dirty tree alone do not
   require a refresh. Explain the gap and consume the returned evidence before
   continuing setup; do not repeat the same resolved handoff.

Do not run a second broad repository discovery pass when the generated context
already answers the setup question. This reuse applies only to repository
facts; requirements, domain rules, ADRs, and workflow decisions remain owned by
their authoritative documents.

Discover real commands from files such as:

* `package.json`;
* `pnpm-workspace.yaml`;
* `go.mod`;
* `Makefile`;
* `pyproject.toml`;
* CI workflows;
* repository documentation.

Do not run installation, migration, deployment, destructive, or expensive commands merely to discover how the project works.

Do not read the entire repository when targeted inspection is sufficient.

## Classify the project

Determine whether the repository is:

### New project

Use this classification when there is little or no established project structure, implementation, or durable project context.

A new project may have decisions handed off from `$grill-workflow`.

Persist those decisions without asking the user to repeat them.

### Existing project

Use this classification when meaningful code, configuration, documentation, or conventions already exist.

Preserve existing naming, architecture, document style, and workflows whenever they are usable.

Do not restructure an existing repository simply to make it match the Phat defaults.

Phat conventions are fallback conventions, not a reason to rewrite a healthy project.

Before continuing setup for an existing project, apply [Reuse fresh codebase
context](#reuse-fresh-codebase-context). Request brownfield discovery only for
a material unresolved gap; do not reset an established implementation workflow
simply because its generated snapshot is absent or older.

## Handoff from Grill Workflow

When invoked from `$grill-workflow`, treat explicitly confirmed decisions from that workflow as agreed input.

Preserve a request for visual validation as workflow intent. It determines the
next handoff, but does not make prototype visuals authoritative requirements.

Persist them into their appropriate project sources.

Use this mapping:

* product goal, users, outcome, scope, and constraints → `docs/requirement.md`;
* confirmed design summary from `$grill-design` → `docs/requirement.md` under
  `## UI Design Requirements`, or the existing authoritative design location;
  preserve scope, stable decision IDs, per-decision status/kind, basis, and
  verification; retain completed discovery so it is not treated as pending;
* pending custom-design discovery and visual-validation preference → preserve
  as workflow intent in the requirements/handoff, not as confirmed styling;
* domain vocabulary, concepts, relationships, invariants, and business rules → `CONTEXT.md`;
* project verification modes → `CONTEXT.md` under `## Verification Policy`;
* significant architecture or technology decisions → `docs/adr/NNNN-<decision>.md`;
* working rules, repository commands, conventions, and navigation → `AGENTS.md`.

Do not re-grill decisions that were already explicitly confirmed.

Do not silently upgrade a Proposal or Open question from grilling into an agreed decision.

If the handoff contains unresolved information, preserve it as `pending`, `draft`, or an explicit open question.

Never fill the gap yourself merely to make setup appear complete.

## Facts, decisions, and unknowns

Distinguish between:

* repository facts;
* agreed decisions;
* discovered conventions;
* unresolved questions;
* conflicting sources.

Do not infer an intended product decision merely because the current code behaves a certain way.

Existing implementation is evidence of current behavior, not automatically the intended requirement.

If two existing sources disagree:

1. preserve both;
2. identify the conflict;
3. avoid choosing a winner unless an authoritative decision already resolves it;
4. route the unresolved decision to `$grill-workflow` when it materially affects future work.

## Configure verification policy

Before completing setup, inspect `CONTEXT.md` for the project-owned
`## Verification Policy` section. Use
[the verification policy reference](references/verification-policy.md) for
the canonical shape and validity rules.

If the section is absent, ask one grouped confirmation containing four
independent choices. Do not infer a value or persist a partial policy. Ask the
user to choose `auto`, `required`, or `off` separately for:

* `unit-test`;
* `integration-test`;
* `e2e-test`; and
* `code-review`.

After all four choices are explicit, repeat the complete set of modes for
confirmation, then persist one `## Verification Policy` section in `CONTEXT.md`
using the reference shape. Preserve the user's choices exactly and report the
confirmed policy in setup output. If `CONTEXT.md` does not exist yet, create it
through the normal durable-document flow and include the policy section.

If a valid confirmed policy already exists, treat it as authoritative: do not
ask the four questions again, do not reset any value, and do not overwrite
unrelated context. Report that the existing policy was reused.

If the section exists but is missing a capability, contains a value other than
`auto`, `required`, or `off`, or contains duplicate capability rows, treat the
policy as unresolved rather than inventing a value. Preserve the unresolved
section, stop before the downstream handoff, and ask for all four choices before
replacing it with a complete confirmed policy.

The persisted project policy is separate from any later per-task override.
Setup must not write task-specific exceptions into `CONTEXT.md`.

## Durable documents and conventions

Read [the setup documentation reference](references/documentation-and-conventions.md) when creating or updating durable documents, choosing their source-of-truth ownership, recording repository commands, or deciding whether a workflow/ADR artifact is justified. It contains the detailed structure and conventions for those branches.

## Idempotency

This skill must be safe to run repeatedly.

When rerun:

* preserve existing decisions;
* preserve established document style;
* update stale navigation when justified;
* add missing information supported by evidence;
* avoid duplicate sections;
* avoid duplicate documents;
* avoid duplicate ADRs;
* avoid resetting status fields;
* preserve a valid confirmed verification policy instead of asking again or
  rewriting its values;
* avoid replacing project-specific conventions with generic Phat defaults.

If no changes are needed, leave the repository unchanged and report that setup is already complete.

## Quality gate

Before finishing, verify that:

* `AGENTS.md` points to the relevant project sources of truth when applicable;
* known product context has an authoritative home;
* known domain context has an authoritative home;
* significant agreed architecture decisions are recorded when needed;
* unresolved decisions remain explicitly unresolved;
* discovered commands are evidence-based;
* `CONTEXT.md` contains one complete, inspectable verification policy with
  explicit `auto`, `required`, or `off` modes for `unit-test`, `integration-test`,
  `e2e-test`, and `code-review`, or setup has stopped with the policy unresolved;
* available repository context was reused and setup-critical facts verified,
  or a concrete gap requiring broad discovery was routed to `$code-to-context`;
* no empty future documents were created;
* no duplicate source of truth was introduced;
* no new product or architecture decision was made by setup itself;
* another agent can determine where to find requirements, context, specs, and tasks;
* rerunning this skill would not create duplicate content.

Fix setup problems before finishing when they can be fixed without making a new project decision.

## Finish

Report:

1. project classification: new or existing;
2. files created;
3. files updated;
4. relevant files intentionally left unchanged;
5. discovered commands;
6. confirmed or unresolved verification policy;
7. conflicts or unresolved questions;
8. workflow readiness;
9. next skill.

Use this routing:

```text
material product/domain/architecture decision unresolved
    → $grill-workflow

existing implementation with missing or stale generated Codebase Context
    → $code-to-context

custom-design discovery explicitly requested and still pending
    → $grill-design

project context ready + visual validation explicitly requested
    → $to-prototype

project context ready + feature requirement agreed + no visual validation requested
    → $write-spec

project context ready but next work is unclear
    → $ask-workflow
```

A recommendation from `$grill-workflow` or `$grill-design` is not automatic
invocation. When the user invokes setup, reuse the agreed handoff without
re-grilling; recommend the next workflow without executing it.

After setup succeeds, recommend `$grill-design` first if custom-design discovery
is explicitly requested and still pending; do not repeat completed discovery.
Otherwise, hand off directly to `$to-prototype` if visual validation was
requested, or `$write-spec` when the feature is sufficiently defined.

Do not implement the feature.

Do not create implementation tasks.

Do not manufacture decisions merely to advance the workflow.
