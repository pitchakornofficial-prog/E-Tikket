# Verify Feature

Answer whether the selected feature meets its agreed contract, including behavior
spanning multiple tasks. Return an evidence report; do not implement fixes or
change requirements, specs, task status, review history, or verification policy.
This assessment does not replace task-owned tests or `$code-review` approval.

## Fix the assessment scope

Read repository guidance, the full owning spec and relevant requirement, all
linked tasks, applicable accepted design/prototype decisions, effective
verification policy, and current source/test evidence. Identify the feature,
AC IDs, revision plus relevant working-tree changes, and environment assessed.
If the target is ambiguous, inspect the current conversation and task links,
then ask only for the missing target while continuing independent inspection.

Do not infer a feature contract from code alone. If no usable contract exists,
report the precise gap and recommend `$write-spec` for agreed behavior or
`$grill-workflow` for unresolved intent. Missing generated context alone is not
a reason to request `$code-to-context`.

## Evaluate acceptance and cross-task behavior

Map every in-scope AC to its owning task(s), current implementation, and evidence.
Explicitly superseded/retired criteria remain traceable history; cite their
accepted replacement or withdrawal and exclude them from current satisfaction
requirements. Do not treat missing behavior as permission to retire a criterion.
Check the actual boundaries relevant to the contract: a producer and consumer
agreeing on an interface, persistence visible to the next step, permission checks
throughout a journey, or a failure path shared across tasks. Do not invent
requirements for unrelated accessibility, security, performance, or infrastructure.

For each AC, use one result:

- `satisfied`: attributable evidence supports the criterion on the assessed state;
- `failed`: observed behavior contradicts the agreed criterion;
- `unverified`: evidence is missing, stale for relevant changes, or unavailable;
- `not applicable`: the authoritative scoped contract explicitly excludes it;
  explain the source, not merely why a test was skipped.

Separate observed failures from planned incomplete work. A `todo`/`in_progress`
task can explain an unmet criterion without creating a new product conflict.
Task `done` is not proof, a test file's presence is not a pass, and a unit test
that mocks out an integration cannot prove that integration works. Link credible
prior checks to their revision/environment and state whether independently rerun.
A different SHA alone does not invalidate evidence; assess relevant changes.

## Verification execution

Inspect repository-supported commands before running them. Reuse credible
current evidence; run bounded local checks needed to close material gaps when
available. Tests/builds may create normal disposable outputs, but must not modify
source, tests, canonical documents, or task state. Do not install dependencies,
change runners/configuration, access live services, or run migrations/deployments
merely to obtain a pass. Stop unsafe checks and report the exact prerequisite.
Never expose secret values.

Honor existing required gates and explicit overrides; do not enable disabled
capabilities or silently waive required checks. Do not automatically dispatch
`unit-test`, `integration-test`, `e2e-test`, or `code-review`: their task-owned
write/status boundaries remain with `$implement-task`. If a new test or a fix
is needed, report the affected AC/task and leave writes to that workflow.
A missing runner produces `unverified`, not an invented pass or an automatic
setup/reset. Verification-policy `off` does not mean acceptance was demonstrated.

## Result and next action

Report `verified` only if every applicable AC is satisfied and required feature
verification is evidenced. Otherwise report `not verified`, separating confirmed
gaps from unavailable evidence. Include an AC → task → evidence → result table,
checks run/not run, relevant boundary findings, and the assessed revision/state.
Distinguish feature evidence from task approval: unreviewed tasks stay unreviewed,
even when all observed behavior works. Do not mark a spec or task `done`.

For findings, recommend at most one primary action based on the blocking cause:

- known incomplete work or bounded defect: `$implement-task` for the owning open
  task; for a `done` task, report a follow-up/reopen choice without reopening it;
- unexplained failure: `$debug-task`;
- agreed criterion without task coverage: `$to-tasks`;
- an explicitly requested contract change: `$change-scope`; never use it just
  because code fails the current spec;
- missing task approval: `$code-review` for the pending review, without invoking it;
- unavailable environment evidence: report its concrete remedy, not a new stage.

If verified, finish. Do not automatically require `$release-check`, another
verification run, or a context refresh. Save a report only when requested, using
the repository's existing report convention; otherwise return it in the response.
