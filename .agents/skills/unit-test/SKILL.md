# Unit Test

Verify isolated behavior for the current implementation task using only a
runner that the repository already documents or exposes. This skill is a test
capability dispatched by `implement-task` as a dedicated sub-agent; it does not
choose project policy, modify production code, or create a missing testing
stack.

## Role boundary

This capability covers isolated rules, calculations, validation, pure
transformations, and state transitions that can be verified without crossing a
module, service, database, queue, browser, or user journey boundary.

Do not dispatch another capability or sub-agent from this capability. Do not
use it to verify integration boundaries or end-to-end flows. Do not select a
test framework, install a dependency, start a service, or invent a runner
command. The task, specification, repository context, and explicit project
policy remain authoritative.

## Workflow

Follow this sequence:

```text
Read task and project context
        ↓
Determine whether unit verification is relevant
        ↓
Resolve exactly one existing repository runner
        ↓
Run the task-relevant unit scope, or report an unresolved gate
        ↓
Report commands, results, findings, and file ownership
```

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, the selected task, its linked specification,
and the relevant implementation before selecting a scope. Read existing unit
tests and repository test guidance when present; do not scan unrelated code.

## Determine relevance

Run unit verification only when the task scope or observable acceptance
criteria includes isolated behavior. Identify the exact rules, modules, or
test files that justify the selection.

If the unit mode is `off`, a task-only override sets it to `off`, or the task
does not contain isolated behavior, return `skipped with reason` and do not run
a command. The reason must identify the mode or task-scope evidence;
availability of a unit runner is not itself a reason to run it.

## Resolve one runner

Inspect only repository-supported evidence, such as:

* commands and test conventions in `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and repository
  documentation;
* package-manager scripts and test configuration when those files exist;
* language manifests, Makefiles, task runners, and CI workflows; and
* existing unit-test files and their nearby configuration.

Prefer an explicitly documented unit command. If documentation is absent,
use a runner command only when repository configuration identifies one
unambiguously. Record the evidence path and the exact command.

If no usable runner is detected, return `blocked` with `runner: missing` and
execute nothing. If more than one runner or command is a plausible match and
repository evidence does not select one, return `blocked` with
`runner: ambiguous` and list the candidates. Never install or upgrade a
skill, dependency, browser, service, or replacement runner to resolve the
result.

## Test-file ownership

The current task and its specification define the task-owned test-file scope.
The capability may create or update only those test files, and only when the
task explicitly owns test changes or the main agent has assigned that scope.

It may read existing tests needed for selection and execution. It must not
modify production files, configuration, fixtures owned by another task,
unrelated tests, `CONTEXT.md`, requirements, specifications, task metadata,
or Git state. If a useful test change has no clear task-owned path, report the
boundary as an unresolved finding instead of creating an arbitrary file.

## Test quality

Choose a stable observable interface that reaches the task's actual failure
pattern. Derive expected results independently from requirements or known
examples; do not repeat the production algorithm inside assertions. Prefer
behavior/results over private methods or incidental internal call counts.
A red result must represent the intended symptom, not missing setup/imports.
When reporting a regression, distinguish a failure observed before the fix from
a test only run on fixed code; do not invent prior red evidence.

Keep isolated dependencies deterministic using the project's established test
pattern; external I/O, time, or randomness may be substituted. Do not force a
real database/browser into unit tests or universally ban test doubles for
internal collaborators. Verify the isolated rule, not the implementation wiring.

Use the narrowest meaningful scope. Avoid speculative extra test levels or
mandatory user approval for seams already established by task/spec. The main
agent owns red/green production fixes; this capability remains test-only and
returns failures for that agent to resolve.

Adaptation details and license: [upstream](references/upstream.md).

## Execution and outcomes

Run the smallest relevant unit scope first and use the exact detected command.
Do not hide failures, weaken assertions, delete tests, or reinterpret a
runner error as a pass.

Use these statuses:

* `passed` — the selected unit scope ran and passed;
* `failed` — the runner executed and reported a failure;
* `blocked` — required runner or scope resolution is missing, ambiguous,
  unavailable, or inconclusive;
* `skipped with reason` — policy, task scope, or an explicit override makes
  this capability inapplicable; and
* `overridden` — policy-selection metadata with its rationale, never a
  substitute for the observed run or skip result. Also report the actual outcome
  under the effective mode; a selected relevant gate still must pass.

A failed, blocked, or inconclusive selected and relevant unit gate remains a
required result for the main agent to resolve. The capability reports the
result; the main agent owns implementation fixes, reruns, and finalization.

## Report contract

Return an observable report containing every field below:

```text
Capability: unit-test
Status: passed | failed | blocked | skipped with reason | overridden
Relevance: relevant | irrelevant — <task-scope reason>
Runner: <one detected runner and evidence path>, or missing/ambiguous
Scope: <task-owned unit behavior and test files considered>
Commands: <exact commands executed, or none>
Results: <exit/result summary and relevant output>
Changed test files: <paths, or none>
Findings: <failures, unresolved risks, or none>
Write boundary: <confirmation that only task-owned test files changed>
Limitations: <missing infrastructure or uncertainty, or none>
```

For `blocked`, include why resolution could not continue and the unblock
condition. For `skipped with reason` or `overridden`, include the policy value
or explicit user rationale. Do not claim `passed` without an observed result.

## Finish

Stop after returning the report. Do not invoke another capability, change
production implementation, alter task status, commit, push, or install
anything.
