# UI Design

Make the interface fit its users, content, and primary action rather than a
generic generated template. Apply the design in the authorized files; a mood
description alone is not the deliverable when the caller requested working UI.

## Composition contract

This is a supporting skill, not a Phat workflow stage. A parent such as
`$to-prototype`, `$edit-prototype`, or `$implement-task` may load it inline
before UI work and retain ownership of scope, files, revisions, verification,
and handoff. Using it does not require a separate agent.

Use it when the work involves meaningful composition, hierarchy, responsive
layout, visual identity, or remediation of generic UI. Skip it for a label
change, a behavior-only fix, or wiring an established component whose design
is already determined. It can also handle an explicit, bounded UI request.

Work only within the caller's authorized surface. Do not change business rules,
requirements, specs, task criteria/status, or confirmed design direction. In a
prototype, keep mock behavior and proposal labels; in production, use the
project's actual components and behavior. Do not redesign neighboring screens
or edit accepted prototypes during implementation.

## Establish a design basis

Read relevant requirements, project context, the owning task/spec when present,
accepted visual references, and nearby UI before choosing a direction. Reuse
the project's tokens, components, assets, and confirmed `Design Direction`.
Read the applicable confirmed `UI Design Requirements` in
`docs/requirement.md` (or its linked authoritative equivalent), including the
scoped decisions produced by `$grill-design`. Apply constraints as requirements,
preferences as guidance, and delegated choices as latitude. Use only Agreed
entries for authority; pending or Proposal entries are not confirmed direction. Do not
rewrite this reusable skill to customize one project.

Respect an explicitly confirmed scoped override of a base Design Direction;
otherwise preserve both sources and return any unresolved conflict to the
parent. The project's explicit visual choices take precedence over this skill's
aesthetic defaults. If design discovery was skipped or no brief exists, continue
with the established direction or provisional treatment below. Behavioral
sources remain authoritative if a visual reference conflicts.

Before writing UI, form a short working brief:

- Who uses this screen, what they need to understand, and its primary action.
- Required content, important states, and likely content lengths/density.
- Existing visual constraints and the composition that serves this content.

Keep this in working notes or the parent update; do not create a new project
document merely to satisfy this skill. If a material product decision is
missing, return it to the parent instead of making it through design.

If no direction exists, choose a coherent provisional treatment suited to the
domain and describe the consequential visual assumptions as proposals. Do not
persist them as confirmed branding without explicit user agreement.
For example, an operations screen needs scanable records and clear status;
a booking form needs sequence and validation; a portfolio may benefit from
image-led composition. These are decision examples, not mandatory templates.

## Compose from content

Start with actual required content and useful grouping. Establish a clear
reading order and primary action before adding decoration.

- Choose layout by the relationship between content: rows or tables for
  comparison, grouped fields for input, sections for narrative, and cards when
  items are independent. Do not wrap every region in an identical card.
- Use realistic domain-specific labels and representative data. Test long
  names, translated text where relevant, empty results, and errors. Do not
  invent metrics, testimonials, claims, or product features to fill space.
- Make hierarchy through type size, weight, spacing, alignment, and contrast.
  Avoid oversized titles on dense working screens and equally prominent CTAs.
- Use a small consistent set of spacing, type, color, radius, and elevation
  tokens. Fit existing tokens first; do not create a second design system for
  a single screen. Account for the actual language and its font support.
- Give surfaces, borders, and accent colors a role: grouping, interaction,
  status, or deliberate brand expression. Decorative effects should support
  that role rather than compete with content.
- Use imagery when it communicates the product, subject, or evidence. Reuse
  suitable authorized assets; never require image generation or stock photos
  for every interface. Keep missing-asset placeholders honest.
- Use motion to explain a state change or spatial relationship. Keep it
  restrained and respect reduced-motion preferences.

Avoid defaulting to gradient heroes, floating glass panels, arbitrary pill
badges, emoji icons, repeated three-card grids, decorative blobs, or excessive
shadows merely because they are easy to generate. They are not blanket bans:
retain them when requested or justified by the established design. Removing
color and personality from every screen is not a substitute for composition.

A useful check: if the product name were replaced, would the same screen fit
almost any unrelated product? If so, improve the content structure, domain
details, and action hierarchy rather than adding more decoration.

## Build the complete UI surface

Reuse existing semantic elements and components. Do not add a framework,
component library, font service, or dependency solely to make the UI look
polished. Follow the caller's stack and installation policy.

Represent relevant normal, empty, loading, error, disabled, and success states
within the agreed scope; do not manufacture states unrelated to the feature.
Keep controls understandable with labels, keyboard operation, visible focus,
adequate contrast, and errors attached to the affected inputs. Do not convey
status only through color or hide essential actions until hover.

Plan responsive changes by priority and content, not only by shrinking the
desktop layout. Keep navigation and actions reachable; allow text to wrap;
choose an explicit small-screen treatment for tables and dense controls.
Preserve useful information rather than hiding it to make a screenshot fit.

## Inspect and refine

When a browser/rendering tool is available, inspect the rendered target at a
representative desktop and narrow mobile width. Exercise the primary action
and relevant states, and check keyboard focus, overflow, clipped text, visual
hierarchy, adherence to applicable confirmed design decisions and their
verification notes, and consistency with neighboring UI. A DOM or source-code check
alone does not establish visual quality.

Fix observed problems within scope and inspect again after material changes.
For shared styling, check affected neighboring screens for regressions. Scale
the inspection to the change; a local spacing adjustment does not require a
whole-site redesign or an exhaustive visual audit.

If rendering is unavailable, perform feasible structural checks and report
visual inspection as unverified. Do not claim screenshots, accessibility
compliance, or responsive success without the corresponding evidence. This
inspection supplements the parent's required tests and review gates.

## Return to the caller

Return the changed files, consequential design choices and their basis,
states/widths actually inspected, and remaining assumptions or limitations.
Keep the report proportional to the work. The parent owns prototype IDs,
task evidence, status transitions, and the next workflow step.
