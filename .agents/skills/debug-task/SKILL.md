description: "Diagnose a reported bug, task failure, or performance regression with a symptom-specific reproduction and evidence-driven probes. Use standalone for diagnosis or inline within implement-task/auto-implement when the cause is unclear; leave production fixes, verification policy, and task status to the owning workflow."

# Debug Task

Find the cause of the reported symptom before patching it. Return a reproducible
signal, supporting evidence, and a bounded fix direction rather than a plausible
story. This supporting diagnostic skill does not mark a task done or replace a
selected test capability.

## Ownership and inputs

Read relevant AGENTS.md, CONTEXT.md, task/spec and acceptance criteria when
present, the exact failure output, and the smallest relevant source/test surface.
Establish expected versus actual behavior, trigger, environment, and the last
known good state if available. Do not treat existing code as intended behavior.

A parent `$implement-task` or `$auto-implement` may compose this skill inline
when ordinary failure classification cannot identify a cause. The parent owns
production fixes, regression tests, task records, policy, and verification
sub-agent dispatch. A test sub-agent may use the diagnostic reasoning within
its existing read/test-file limits; it must not start another agent or edit
production/configuration. No extra verification role is introduced.

Standalone invocation authorizes diagnosis, not production fixes or requirement
changes. Use task-owned files or a temporary diagnostic workspace when needed;
any production instrumentation requires explicit scope authorization. Preserve
unrelated work and never provision services, install runners, deploy, or change
Git history merely to reproduce a bug.

## Reproduce, test a cause, and report

For the operational loop, read [the diagnosis guide](references/diagnosis-guide.md).
Choose a repository-supported check or authorized local reproduction that
exercises the user's exact symptom. Capture an actual failing result before
claiming a reproduction. Minimize it without removing the boundary that causes
the bug; a unit test cannot substitute for a multi-component failure it omits.

Use evidence to distinguish candidate causes. Make a prediction and change one
variable per probe; record what the result rules in or out. Scale this to the
problem: an obvious deterministic failure does not need an arbitrary number of
hypotheses, and an intermittent failure is not disproved by one successful run.

If the failure cannot be reproduced, report the attempts and missing evidence.
Read-only investigation may return unconfirmed hypotheses and specific next
probes; do not claim a proven cause or speculatively patch production. Ask for
only the necessary redacted artifact, access, or configuration. Return a genuine
user-action blocker to the parent; auto-implement then stops the whole batch.

Report expected/actual behavior, the reproduction command or manual steps and
observed verdict, minimized trigger, cause with evidence/confidence, regression
seam, proposed fix boundary, and checks still needed. Identify temporary artifacts
and remove only this run's instrumentation after use. If the parent still needs
an artifact, hand over its path and explicit cleanup ownership. Do not erase
pre-existing logs or rewrite tests/requirements to make a reproduction pass.

Standalone diagnosis hands a known task fix to `$implement-task`; missing task
scope/spec decisions go to `$to-tasks`, `$write-spec`, or `$grill-workflow` as
appropriate. Inline diagnosis returns to the parent without running the fix.
