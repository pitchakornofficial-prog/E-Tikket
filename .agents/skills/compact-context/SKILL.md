# Compact Context

Compress a temporary agent handoff without changing its meaning or becoming a new source of truth.

This is an inline utility, not a Phat workflow stage. A parent skill may call it
when a handoff is materially verbose, repetitive, or multilingual. It returns a
temporary summary; the parent still owns the next workflow step.

## When to use

Use this utility only when:

- a handoff contains material repetition or long conversational history;
- several notes express the same fact or constraint;
- the next agent needs a smaller working context;
- a confirmed-decision summary from `$grill-workflow` is verbose or multilingual.

If the input is already concise, return it with only safe normalization.

## When not to use

Do not:

- replace, rewrite, or summarize `CONTEXT.md`, requirements, ADRs, specs, or tasks;
- use the compacted result instead of reading a canonical artifact in full;
- insert it between a spec and `$to-tasks`, a task and `$implement-task`, or a
  spec and `$code-review`;
- call it by default from `$code-to-context`;
- route the project or invoke another workflow skill automatically;
- compact user-facing copy, legal text, UI labels, or exact quoted wording unless
  the parent explicitly requests that transformation.

Canonical documents remain the source of truth.

## Preserve

Keep every item that could change downstream behavior:

- the goal and intended outcome;
- confirmed decisions and their decision state;
- observed facts and relevant inferences;
- hard product, domain, technical, security, legal, and operational constraints;
- explicit in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries;
- exact identifiers, paths, routes, commands, URLs, interfaces, schema names,
  status values, task/spec/ADR IDs, and `AC-##` meaning;
- references needed by the next skill;
- unresolved material questions;
- conflicts between authoritative documents and implementation evidence.

Never turn a proposal into a confirmed decision or resolve a conflict during
compaction.

## Remove

Remove or merge only information that is semantically redundant:

- greetings, filler, and conversational transitions;
- repeated rationale after its decision is explicit;
- duplicate facts, references, or recommendations;
- rejected proposals that are clearly marked rejected;
- verbose prose that can become a precise bullet.

Do not remove a detail merely because it appears small.

## Normalize

Use concise English for agent-facing prose when meaning remains safe.

Translate meaning rather than word order. Preserve Thai or other domain terms when
no safe English equivalent exists, with at most one short gloss.

Never translate or alter code, identifiers, paths, commands, URLs, environment
variables, database/API names, task/spec/ADR IDs, acceptance IDs, or exact
user-facing copy.

Preserve decision labels such as:

`Confirmed`, `Proposal`, `Observed`, `Inferred`, `Open`, and `Conflict`.

## Output

Return the smallest useful Markdown shape. Omit empty sections.

```markdown
Goal:
<one sentence>

Confirmed:
- ...

Facts:
- ...

Constraints:
- ...

Scope:
- In: ...
- Out: ...

References:
- SPEC-...
- TASK-...
- AC-...
- path/to/file

Open:
- ...

Conflicts:
- ...
```

Use compact notation only when it remains unambiguous. Keep separate acceptance
criteria separate when they are independently verifiable.

## Loss check

Before returning, verify that the result preserves:

- goal and confirmed decisions;
- facts, constraints, and scope;
- exact identifiers and references;
- unresolved material questions and conflicts;
- status or dependency information needed by the next skill;
- every acceptance criterion identifier and behavioral meaning.

If a detail might materially change implementation, specification, review, or routing,
keep it.

## Calling contract

The parent skill owns invocation and continuation:

```text
parent workflow
    ↓
prepare temporary handoff
    ↓
$compact-context
    ↓
continue with the parent's chosen next step
```

Return only the compacted handoff unless the parent requests metadata. Do not
explain the compression process, add recommendations, make decisions, or modify
project files.
