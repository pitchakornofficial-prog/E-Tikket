# Write Spec

Turn agreed decisions into one durable specification for one feature or coherent change.

Define what the system must do, what users or other systems can observe, and how the behavior will be verified.

When visual validation is requested, this skill may hand off to the optional
prototype flow. The prototype is supporting visual evidence; the behavioral
spec remains the source of truth.

Do not invent unresolved product or architecture decisions.

Do not implement the feature.

Do not decompose the feature into implementation tasks.

## Workflow

Follow this sequence:

```text
Read project context
        ↓
Confirm specification readiness
        ↓
Find existing related spec
        ↓
Create or update one spec
        ↓
Define observable behavior
        ↓
Define acceptance criteria
        ↓
Map acceptance criteria to verification
        ↓
Run quality gate
        ↓
draft → grill-workflow
ready + visual validation requested → to-prototype → edit-prototype* → spec-with-prototype
accepted prototype → spec-with-prototype
ready without prototype work → to-tasks
```

## Read before writing

Read `AGENTS.md` first if it exists.

Then inspect only the relevant project sources:

* `docs/requirement.md`
* `CONTEXT.md`
* applicable confirmed UI Design Requirements in requirements or a linked
  authoritative design brief, including scoped decisions from `$grill-design`
* relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/`
* existing specs under `docs/specs/`
* relevant prototype pages under `docs/assets/prototype/` when a prototype is
  referenced or already exists
* existing interfaces, routes, schemas, or code when needed to understand current behavior
* existing tests when they reveal observable contracts or established verification patterns

Preserve repository terminology, naming, document style, and existing source-of-truth boundaries.

Treat existing implementation as evidence of current behavior, not automatically as the intended requirement.

Do not silently turn implementation details or assumptions into product decisions.

## Preconditions

Before writing a spec, confirm that the following are sufficiently agreed when relevant:

* the problem being solved;
* target users or actors;
* desired outcome;
* feature scope;
* important business rules;
* important domain concepts;
* permissions or ownership rules;
* critical integrations;
* major architecture decisions that constrain the feature.

If the standard Phat project context has not been initialized and the information belongs in project-level context rather than this feature spec, stop and route to `$setup-project`.

If the user wants to see or iterate on the UI before the behavioral contract is
finalized, keep the spec at its current honest status and route to
`$edit-prototype` for targeted existing revisions or `$to-prototype` for new
prototype work. If an accepted revision is already ready to reconcile, route
to `$spec-with-prototype` instead. Do not treat the prototype as a replacement
for this spec.

If a missing decision would materially change:

* feature scope;
* user-visible behavior;
* business rules;
* data ownership;
* permissions;
* integration contracts;
* architecture;
* or acceptance criteria;

do not guess.

Create or keep the spec as `draft`, record the blocking question, and route the decision back to `$grill-workflow`.

Do not use grilling for low-impact implementation details that can safely be resolved during task planning or implementation.

## Changes to an existing agreement

Use `$change-scope` when a requested behavioral change requires coordinated
reconciliation of existing requirements, the owning spec, and its task plan.
Ordinary spec clarification or decomposition stays here. When this skill is
already supporting `change-scope` and the changed behavior is settled, complete
its scoped spec/planning work and return to that parent; do not route back to
`change-scope` again. Preserve delivered tasks and evidence, and plan follow-up
work for changed behavior instead of silently reopening completed tasks.

## Find the owning spec first

Before allocating a new SPEC ID, inspect existing specs for the same feature, behavior, or coherent change.

Prefer updating an existing spec when it already owns the behavior being changed.

Do not create competing sources of truth such as:

```text
SPEC-003-booking.md
SPEC-008-booking-update.md
SPEC-012-new-booking.md
```

when they describe the same behavioral contract.

Create a new spec only when the change has a distinct:

* purpose;
* behavior boundary;
* lifecycle;
* acceptance boundary;
* or independently reviewable outcome.

When creating a new spec, choose the next unused ID and create:

```text
docs/specs/SPEC-###-<short-slug>.md
```

Preserve the repository's existing spec naming or numbering convention if one already exists.

## Specification boundary

A spec defines the behavioral contract.

Focus on:

* what must happen;
* who can do it;
* under what conditions;
* what data or state is involved;
* what can fail;
* what is observable;
* and how success can be verified.

Do not turn the spec into an implementation plan.

Avoid prescribing:

* file names;
* component trees;
* class names;
* helper functions;
* task ordering;
* migration steps;
* internal refactors;
* exact module placement;

unless one of those is already an agreed architectural contract or is itself externally significant.

Implementation decomposition belongs to `$to-tasks`.

Use references to requirements, context, and ADRs rather than copying their rationale into the spec.

Link applicable Agreed design decisions by their stable IDs. Preserve mandatory
visual constraints and map observable ones to appropriate verification; do not
promote preferences, delegated choices, or draft design proposals into acceptance
requirements. A conflict in visual intent belongs to `$grill-design`; a conflict
in product behavior belongs to `$grill-workflow`. Design discovery remains
optional and its absence does not itself prevent a spec from being ready.

## Spec content and quality

When creating or updating a spec, read [the spec template and quality reference](references/spec-template-and-quality.md). It contains the full content template and the detailed acceptance, verification, traceability, and status rules.

## Quality gate

Before finishing, inspect the complete spec.

Confirm:

* one spec owns one coherent behavioral change;
* an existing owning spec was not unnecessarily duplicated;
* scope does not exceed the agreed requirement;
* project-level rationale is linked rather than copied;
* implementation details have not leaked into the behavioral contract without reason;
* in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries are understandable;
* user-visible and system-visible behavior is sufficiently defined;
* relevant data ownership and permissions are covered;
* important errors and edge cases are covered;
* non-functional requirements appear only when actually relevant;
* every acceptance criterion has a unique `AC-##` ID;
* every acceptance criterion is observable;
* every acceptance criterion maps to verification;
* blocking open questions prevent `ready`;
* links to requirements, context, and ADRs actually support the spec.

If the quality gate fails, fix the spec where possible.

If fixing it requires a new product, domain, or architecture decision, keep the spec `draft` and route that decision to `$grill-workflow`.

## Finish

Report:

1. spec path;
2. whether the spec was created or updated;
3. status: `draft`, `ready`, or `done`;
4. number of acceptance criteria;
5. blocking open questions, if any;
6. non-blocking open questions, if any;
7. next skill.

Choose the next skill using this rule:

```text
blocking decision exists
        → $grill-workflow

accepted prototype needs to update the owning spec
        → $spec-with-prototype

further visual validation requested, without an accepted revision ready to reconcile
        → $edit-prototype for targeted existing revisions, otherwise $to-prototype

spec is ready without prototype work
        → $to-tasks

project context is not initialized
        → $setup-project
```

Do not implement the feature.

Do not create implementation tasks.

Do not mark a spec `ready` merely to advance the workflow.
