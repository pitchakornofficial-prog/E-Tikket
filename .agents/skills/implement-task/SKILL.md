description: "Implement exactly one ready Phat task within its documented scope, update its Goal/Blocked by/Todo checklist with verified progress, preserve unrelated changes, apply the project's verification and commit policy, and prepare the task for review. Use when a task is todo or an existing in-progress continuation with all dependencies complete."

# Implement Task

Implement exactly one selected task and leave a focused, reviewable diff.

When composed inline by `$auto-implement`, preserve this single-task contract.
The batch owns whole-batch readiness and continuation; this skill still owns
one task's implementation, verification dispatch, and finalization. Explicit
batch authorization includes continuing in-scope recorded review corrections,
but never overrides project policy, scope, or active blockers.

Work from the task's documented behavioral goal, acceptance criteria, constraints, and verification plan.

Do not expand scope into adjacent improvements.

Do not silently rewrite requirements, specs, ADRs, or task acceptance criteria to match the implementation.

Do not push, deploy, or perform destructive operations. Follow the documented
commit policy and preserve unrelated changes.

## Read before changing code

Read `AGENTS.md` first if it exists.

Then inspect:

* the selected task;
* its linked spec;
* acceptance criteria claimed by the task;
* prototype references in the spec and the relevant accepted prototype pages
  when UI behavior or states are part of the task;
* relevant requirement/context;
* relevant ADRs;
* dependency tasks when their delivered behavior affects this task;
* relevant existing code;
* nearby tests;
* repository commands required for verification.

Read the selected task and its linked spec in full. Do not use
`$compact-context` as a substitute for either canonical artifact; compact only
temporary notes after the authoritative behavior remains available.

Read only the code surface needed to implement the task safely.

Do not explore or refactor unrelated areas merely because they appear improvable.

## Preflight

Confirm all of the following before implementation:

* the selected task exists;
* status is `todo`, an existing `in_progress` continuation, or a review-fix /
  resolved-blocker continuation as defined below;
* the linked spec is still `ready`;
* every listed dependency is `done`;
* no active `blocked` reason remains;
* acceptance criteria are concrete;
* task scope is understandable;
* verification is possible;
* relevant repository conventions are known.

If unresolved prototype proposals or conflicts affect the task-owned behavior
or acceptance criteria, stop and route
to `$spec-with-prototype` or `$grill-workflow` before changing code.

If the task is `in_review` with recorded fixable review findings and the user
invokes this skill to continue that task (or an authorized `$auto-implement`
batch continues it), treat it as a review-correction cycle.
Preserve review history, change status to `in_progress` before fixes, and rerun
affected gates before one fresh final review. Otherwise route `in_review` to
`$code-review` without changing implementation.

For a `blocked` task, inspect the recorded unblock condition. Resume the same
task only after evidence shows the blocker is resolved; retain its history,
clear only the resolved active blocker, and return to `in_progress` for remaining
implementation. If implementation is complete and only final review was blocked,
return to `in_review` and route to `$code-review` instead of reimplementing it.

If the task is already `done`, do not reimplement it unless the user explicitly asks to reopen it.

If a dependency is unfinished, stop this task and report the exact dependency.

If the task itself is underspecified, route to `$to-tasks`.

If the spec is no longer sufficient, route to `$write-spec`.

If a product, domain, scope, or architecture decision is required, route to `$grill-workflow`.

## Changed agreements and optional assessments

When the user intends to change an existing agreed behavior across its spec and
task plan, hand that change to `$change-scope`; do not rewrite the contract as
an implementation fix or review waiver. Unsettled product decisions still
belong to `$grill-workflow`. Resume only after the affected contract and task
readiness are reconciled. Existing batch authorization does not include new
follow-up tasks automatically.

`$verify-feature` can assess a requested cross-task acceptance question and
`$release-check` can assess a requested release candidate. Neither replaces
this skill's task verification/review contract or changes its status authority.
Do not invoke them as extra mandatory completion gates.

## Task file contract

Task files created by `$to-tasks` keep only three body sections:

1. `Goal` — the behavioral result and authoritative links.
2. `Blocked by` — upstream task IDs, or the reason and unblock condition for
   an active external blocker.
3. `Todo` — the implementation, verification, and commit checklist.

Keep the task's `Status` and `Spec` metadata intact. Use `- [ ]` for work that
remains and `- [x]` only after the corresponding work is actually complete.
Do not add `Evidence`, `In scope`, `Out of scope`, or other task sections.

## Inspect the working tree

Before editing, inspect the current repository state when version-control information is available.

Identify:

* existing modified files;
* untracked files;
* staged changes;
* changes related to this task;
* unrelated user or agent changes.

Preserve unrelated changes.

Do not reset, discard, overwrite, stash, reformat, or otherwise modify unrelated work merely to obtain a clean working tree.

If an existing change overlaps files required by the task:

1. inspect the overlap;
2. preserve compatible work;
3. distinguish prior changes from changes made for this task;
4. stop only when the overlap cannot be safely reconciled.

A dirty working tree is not automatically a blocker.

## Task ownership

Implement only behavior owned by the selected task.

The selected task may reference multiple acceptance criteria, but implementation must remain within its stated scope.

Use an accepted prototype only as supporting visual evidence for behavior,
states, hierarchy, and interaction flow. Do not treat pixel-level differences
or prototype-only proposals as implementation requirements, and do not edit the
prototype during production implementation.

Do not:

* implement the next task early;
* bundle unrelated cleanup;
* redesign neighboring features;
* add speculative extensibility;
* migrate unrelated code;
* change architecture without an agreed decision.

Small local refactors are acceptable when they are directly required to implement or safely verify the task.

Keep them proportional to the task.

## Status transition

Before meaningful implementation begins, update:

```text
Status: todo
```

to:

```text
Status: in_progress
```

Preserve existing metadata, Goal, Blocked by, and Todo items.

Read the Todo checklist before starting. Do not uncheck completed items or
mark future work complete; check an item only after its result is observed.

If the task was already `in_progress`, continue from the existing state instead of resetting it.

Do not move the task to `in_review` until implementation and required verification are complete enough for review.

## Understand the behavior seam

Before coding, identify the smallest existing behavior seam that can satisfy the task.

When a prototype is referenced, compare implementation against the behavioral
spec first. If the implementation needs to change an accepted behavior that is
not represented in the spec, return to `$spec-with-prototype` instead of
silently changing the contract.

Prefer:

* extending existing components;
* reusing established modules;
* following current patterns;
* using existing abstractions when they remain appropriate.

Avoid creating a new abstraction merely because one could exist.

Reuse before creating.

Change the smallest reasonable surface while still producing a maintainable result.

## Verification and review gates

Read the persisted policy from `CONTEXT.md` before implementation and follow
[verification capability selection](references/verification-capability-selection.md).
If the policy is missing or malformed, stop and route to `$setup-project`.

After implementation, follow [verification gate enforcement](references/verification-gate-enforcement.md)
and [sub-agent dispatch](references/sub-agent-dispatch.md). Test capabilities
run as separate sub-agents, sequentially in the selected order; do not run them
inline or concurrently. Preserve each role's terminal result and write boundary.

After final checks and the `in_review` transition, follow the
[canonical code-review handoff](references/canonical-code-review-handoff.md).
The final reviewer runs once when policy permits, after `in_review`, and owns
the review evidence and status transition. Never use an inline fallback.

## UI design support

Before implementing task-owned UI that requires new composition, hierarchy,
responsive layout, or visual treatment, load `$ui-design` when available and
apply it inline. Supply the selected task/spec, accepted prototype evidence,
existing components/tokens, applicable Agreed UI Design Requirements from
`docs/requirement.md`, relevant states, and exact file/scope boundaries.
Skip it for behavior-only changes or routine use of an established component
whose design is already determined.

Retain ownership of implementation, task records, tests, and review gates.
The supporting skill must preserve authoritative behavior and confirmed design
direction; it may not redesign neighboring features or edit the prototype.
Its rendered inspection supplements required verification. If it is unavailable,
reuse the established UI patterns and report the fallback without auto-installing
it or treating it as a missing verification capability.

## Implementation

Implement the behavior required by the task and its source spec.

Prefer simple code that fits the existing project.

For small and medium web projects, avoid adding operational or architectural complexity without a documented requirement.

Do not introduce without clear need:

* new services;
* queues;
* caches;
* event systems;
* state-management libraries;
* abstraction layers;
* dependencies;
* background workers;
* separate backend services.

When a dependency or new library is genuinely needed, verify that it is justified by the task or existing architecture before adding it.

Do not install or upgrade dependencies casually.

## Implementation details

For unexplained failures or regressions, `$debug-task` may support diagnosis
inline within the task-owned surface. It returns evidence and fix direction;
this skill retains production writes, task status, regression tests, and policy.

Before mapping acceptance criteria, choosing tests or verification, handling a failed check or source conflict, classifying a scope discovery, or preparing the task-scoped commit, read [the implementation reference](references/implementation-details.md). It contains the detailed rules for those branches.

## Finalize the task

Before updating the task record, deciding review readiness, or reporting the
result, read [task finalization](references/task-finalization.md). It defines
the task checklist boundary, blocker and status rules, final quality gate, and
report fields.
