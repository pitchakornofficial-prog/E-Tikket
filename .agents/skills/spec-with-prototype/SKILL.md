description: "Create or update a Phat feature specification using an accepted UI prototype as visual evidence while preserving requirements, domain rules, and ADRs as authoritative sources. Use after to-prototype or edit-prototype when the prototype has been reviewed and should inform the implementation-ready behavioral contract before to-tasks."

# Spec With Prototype

Turn an accepted prototype into specification evidence without making the prototype itself the product source of truth.

Create or update the relevant feature spec so implementation can reproduce the agreed behavior represented by the prototype.

Do not copy every visual detail into the spec.

Do not treat prototype proposals as agreed requirements.

Do not create implementation tasks.

## Workflow

Follow:

```text
Read requirements
        ↓
Read accepted prototype
        ↓
Read existing spec if present
        ↓
Classify prototype decisions
        ↓
Reconcile behavior
        ↓
Create/update spec
        ↓
Map UI states to ACs
        ↓
Quality gate
        ↓
$to-tasks
```

## Read authoritative context first

Read `AGENTS.md` first if it exists.

Then read:

* `docs/requirement.md`;
* `CONTEXT.md`;
* applicable Agreed UI Design Requirements or their linked authoritative brief;
* relevant ADRs;
* relevant existing spec;
* `docs/assets/prototype/`;
* prototype pages relevant to the feature.

Requirements, domain context, and ADRs remain authoritative. Preserve applicable
Agreed design constraints by stable reference; resolve a material visual-direction
conflict through `$grill-design`, and a behavioral conflict through the owning
product/spec workflow. A completed spec remains historical only for inspection;
newly agreed behavior must return it through draft/ready and task reconciliation
rather than changing a delivered contract while retaining done.

Prototype files are supporting visual evidence.

## Identify prototype revisions

Record the exact prototype page revisions being used.

Example:

```text
Prototype references:
- home-v3
- booking-v2
- confirmation-v1
```

Do not refer only to:

```text
"the prototype"
```

when stable prototype IDs are available.

The spec should make it possible to determine which visual revision informed its behavior.

## Find the owning spec

Before creating a new spec, inspect existing specs.

If one already owns the feature, update it.

Do not create:

```text
SPEC-004-booking.md
SPEC-009-booking-prototype.md
```

when both describe the same behavioral contract.

If no owning spec exists, create:

```text
docs/specs/SPEC-###-<short-slug>.md
```

using the repository's existing convention when applicable.

## Prototype reconciliation

When translating prototype evidence into a spec, read [the prototype reconciliation reference](references/prototype-reconciliation.md). It contains the detailed classification, state, acceptance, visual-fidelity, reconciliation, and verification rules.

## Status

Mark the spec `ready` only when:

* prototype revisions are identified;
* material prototype behavior has been classified;
* conflicts are resolved;
* all required UI states are described;
* acceptance criteria remain observable;
* each AC has a verification approach;
* prototype proposals are not masquerading as requirements;
* remaining open questions are non-blocking.

Otherwise keep:

```text
Status: draft
```

Preserve `Status: done` when the owning spec has already been delivered and the
prototype reconciliation is being read as historical evidence.

## Quality gate

Before finishing confirm:

* authoritative requirements were preserved;
* the correct owning spec was updated or created;
* prototype revision IDs are recorded;
* only accepted behavior entered the contract;
* visual-only details were not over-specified;
* prototype proposals remain non-authoritative;
* conflicts were not silently resolved;
* important UI states are represented;
* AC IDs are unique;
* existing AC IDs were preserved when possible;
* every AC is verifiable;
* the spec is ready for implementation decomposition.

## Finish

Report:

1. spec path;
2. created or updated;
3. spec status;
4. prototype revisions used;
5. behaviors added or clarified from prototype;
6. visual-only details intentionally excluded;
7. unresolved conflicts/questions;
8. acceptance-criteria count;
9. next skill.

Use:

```text
prototype needs more visual work
    → $edit-prototype

behavioral/product conflict exists
    → $grill-workflow
      or $write-spec

spec is ready
    → $to-tasks
```

Do not implement production code.

Do not create tasks.

Do not treat prototype existence as user approval.
